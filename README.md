# Pioneer-LA-PSU
Recreation of the Pioneer LaserActive PSU pcb

At some point I aquired a Pioneer LA and seeing the state of some of the traces on the board I decided to try and clone the pcb. In this repository I'll post:

- Gerbers
- Schematics (Needs to be cleaned up and added)
- BOM (needs to be added)
